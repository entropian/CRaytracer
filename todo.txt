After removing normals and tangent in smooth triangle, memory usage increases slightly over time during rendering.
Figure out how to integerate texture mapping to shading.
Figure out how phong material works in path tracing.
Add texture mapping
Figure out how to load san miguel.
Optimize mesh loading
Try different number of primitives in each BVH node
what's the relationship between kd, ks and kr (and kt)?
add normal type to torus
set default background color in scene file
Combine light pointer and light type into a struct?
change some push function arguments to pointers?
Change it so that the image plane isn't totally reliant on fov as input.
the eventual image plane struct could have a samples pointer of its own.
Update the clean up section.



bugs:
Noise when drawing transparent boxes
      cause: bounding box for boxes fit too tight

Blocks appear when drawing a transparent sphere against a white background.
       increasing number of samples has no effect
       it looks like kr/kt is the same within each block
       after zooming in, it seems that there is a gradient within each block
       since kt is derived from kr, it only makes sense that both transmission and reflection are affected
       Cause: scaling up image by non-integer factors?

Smooth triangles causes pdf to be zero in glossy reflection shading, but flat triangles don't?
       see calcSpecRefRadiance in trace.h

Both smooth and flat transparent teapot has stripes on the triangle edges
       see teapot_stripe.png and trans_flat_teapot_stripe.png

Smooth teapot seems darker than flat teapot
       caused by reflected radiance not working properly on smooth triangles.
       see smooth_reflected_only.png
       reflected radiance only appears near quad edges for some reason, which cause those stripes.
       Cause: forgot to normalize the interpolated normal AKA I'm a moron.

Many image sizes cause problems
