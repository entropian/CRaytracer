what's the relationship between kd, ks and kr (and kt)?
ambient shading has problems
add normal type to torus
make solid cylinder movable
set default background color in scene file
put mesh triangles in an array
Combine light pointer and light type into a struct?
Improve objloader so that it can load the dragon
change some push function arguments to pointers?
Change it so that the image plane isn't totally reliant on fov as input.
the eventual image plane struct could have a samples pointer of its own.
Update the clean up section.


path trace is dependent on background color

bugs:
Noise when drawing transparent boxes
      stopping reflected_illum doesn't help
      not caused by the kr nan issue
      cannot be caused by tir,because ior is 1.0
      kt is never zero it seems
      by changing ior from 1 to not 1, it addes noise to the image
      not caused by kt, as when I changed kt to a constant value, there's still noise.
      might be caused by reflect_t and transmit_t.
      no reason for the dark dots to appear when there's no attenuation
      the greater the ior, the darker the spots
try displaying transmit vectors
try coloring the white ones pink

Blocks appear when drawing a transparent sphere against a white background.
       increasing number of samples has no effect
       it looks like kr/kt is the same within each block
       after zooming in, it seems that there is a gradient within each block
       since kt is derived from kr, it only makes sense that both transmission and reflection are affected
       Cause: scaling up image by non-integer factors?


Many image sizes cause problems
