what's the relationship between kd, ks and kr (and kt)?
ambient shading has problems
add normal type to torus
make solid cylinder movable
set default background color in scene file
put mesh triangles in an array
Combine light pointer and light type into a struct?
Improve objloader so that it can load the dragon
change some push function arguments to pointers?
Change it so that the image plane isn't totally reliant on fov as input.
the eventual image plane struct could have a samples pointer of its own.
Update the clean up section.


path trace is dependent on background color

bugs:
Blocks appear when drawing a transparent sphere against a white background.
       increasing number of samples has no effect
       it looks like kr/kt is the same within each block
       after zooming in, it seems that there is a gradient within each block
       since kt is derived from kr, it only makes sense that both transmission and reflection are affected
       Cause: scaling up image by non-integer factors?


Many image sizes cause problems
