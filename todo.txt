what's the relationship between kd, ks and kr?
ambient shading has problems
add normal type to torus
make solid cylinder movable
set default background color in scene file
put mesh triangles in an array
Combine light pointer and light type into a struct?
Improve objloader so that it can load the dragon
change some push function arguments to pointers?
Change it so that the image plane isn't totally reliant on fov as input.
the eventual image plane struct could have a samples pointer of its own.
Update the clean up section.
